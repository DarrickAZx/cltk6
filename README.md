# About
The file `pos_editable_xenophon_anabasis.md` is a human–editable POS–tagged text of [Xenohphon's *Anabasis*](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anabasis_%28Xenophon%29). Any GitHub user can check the quality of a sentence's POS tags, fix or confirm it, and give one's name.

The text was tagged using [the CLTK's TnT tagger](http://docs.cltk.org/en/latest/greek.html#tnt-tagger). The file `Make human-editable POS text from TLG.py` generated `pos_editable_xenophon_anabasis.md`, which was then broken down into files for each book.

Once the *Anabasis* has been tagged, in part or in full, it will be added to [the CLTK's POS tagging training set](https://github.com/cltk/greek_treebank_perseus/blob/master/greek_training_set.pos).
